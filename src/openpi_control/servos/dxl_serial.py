"""Dynamixel serial servo driver — zeroing seam (not integrated yet).

Registered in the servo registry so the structure is in place for serial
servos, but no Dynamixel hardware has been brought up on this stack yet.
Zeroing an X-series servo is a multi-step EEPROM procedure — force Extended
Position Mode, clear the Homing Offset, read the folded present position,
write the single-shot offset, reboot, verify — fully implemented and verified
in robot-test ``pi_control/servos/dxl_serial.py`` (send_command_zero). Port
that routine here (plain pyserial, Protocol 2.0) when integrating the first
Dynamixel arm; the registry, port-type dispatch, and tooling need no changes.
